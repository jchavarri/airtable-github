# Github + Airtable integration

Hello! This project, written in [Reason](reasonml.github.io), explores some basic integration of GitHub issues with Airtable (it updates a field whenever an issue is opened or closed).

It contains:

- A very simple GitHub webhook to handle events from issues (note it will probably throw with other types of events)
- Some functions to update data in Airtable
